# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to port `PSN*4*513` to be in a reasonable shape
for the VistA Community. The package was released for use in the VA with
several shortcomings:

 * Extensive use of vendor specific invocations in non-Kernel code (sftp, mv, rm, stat).
 * Reliance on a remote SSH server to download data files from.
 * A post install that displays error messages.
 * Inability to apply downloaded patches if they were downloaded outside of VISTA.

The new patch, `PSN*4*10001`, uses code in `XU*8.0*10002` in `%ZISH` that
allows for syncing remote https directories via `wget`. In addition the calls
for mkdir, stat, and the like have been encapsulated into the new `%ZISH`. The
post-install has been partially, but not completely fixed. See the sample
installation below to see what to expect.

This patch adds support for Cache/Windows, as the VA code does not fully support it.

# Install

# External Documentation
[VDL](https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=89)

# Notes regarding port
New code in `XU*8.0*10002` was done to encapsulate all vendor specific calls
into Kernel routines. The following are the new entry points needed in `%ZISH`
to support this patch:

 * `$$MKDIR^%ZISH`
 * `$$SIZE^%ZISH`
 * `$$WGETSYNC^%ZISH`

# Options Affected

 * Schedule download of NDF update file [PSN PPS SCHEDULE DOWNLOAD]
 * Schedule Install of NDF Update file [PSN PPS SCHEDULE INSTALL]
 * Manual Download of NDF Update file [PSN PPS MANUAL DOWNLOAD]
 * Manual Install of NDF Update file [PSN PPS MANUAL INSTALL]
 * PPS-N Site Parameters (Enter/Edit) [PSN PPS PARAM]

If you are not starting from the first one, you need to edit the site parameters (field `PPS-N Install Version`) to put in the corresponding version of the PPS DAT file in order for the next update to be done properly.

# Package Usage
After installation, give the users who will run the pharmacy updates the key
`PSN PPS ADMIN` and in addition, the key `PSN PPS COORD` to the user who will
set-up the intial parameters for the system.  After key allocation, the users
will see the PPS-N menu on the [NDFMGR] menu:

You need to edit 4, 5, 6 in order for the system to run. In order to edit, you
need the key `PSN PPS COORD`. 

If you are not starting from the first file, and are transitioning after a 
specific NDF patch,  one, you need to edit the site parameters 
(field `PPS-N Install Version`) to put in the corresponding version of the PPS 
DAT file in order for the next update to be done properly. For example, if you
last installed `PSN\*4.0\*555`, you need to change `PPS-N Install Version` to 7.
THIS STEP IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO PREVENT DATA CORRUPTION. THERE ARE NO OTHER
CHECKS THAT GET PERFORMED.

If you are not planning to download the files from a remote server, you do not
need to edit 5 and 6. This will be the case if you get the files directly from
First DataBank and you deposit them directly on your server.

Here's the config after the edits:

```

```

4 needs to be a directory where you have write authority; if you need to create
the directory, you need execute authority over the containing directory. A Windows/NT
directory format is accepted as well. e.g. `D:\HFS\pps_dat\`.

5 and 6 are the parts of an https url that will get you to the DAT files. In
this case, they represent `https://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/PSN-NATIONAL%20DRUG%20FILE%20(NDF)/PPS_DATS/`.
If you plan to host the dat files yourself, that obviously needs to change. If you plan to self host, make sure that you
use an https server with a valid TLS certificate. You may use a self-signed certificate as long as you add it to the Windows
or Linux trust stores.

Once you are done, you can come back to the menu and run MD (ONLY IF YOU WILL DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM THE REMOTE SERVER--DON'T DO THIS IF YOU GET THE FILES SOME OTHER WAY AND DEPOSIT THEM ON YOUR SERVER. IF THAT'S THE CASE, SKIP TO MI STEP (next step)):

```
Select PPS-N Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: MD  Manual Download of NDF Update file


Warning: This download should only be done during off peak hours!

We just downloaded 8 files! If you get this error: `Error creating directory ...`,
you need to check that you have write permissions to the directory.

NDF updates can be installed now using MI. If you manually put the files in a folder
rather than downloaded them, it will find them and ask you to install them.

```
Select PPS-N Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: mi  Manual Install of NDF Update file


Warning: The NDF update should only be done during off duty hours!
         Installation may take up to 30 minutes, and the following options
         will automatically be disabled during installation then enabled
         once installation has completed.

           * Print A PMI Sheet      * Patient Prescription Processing
           * Release Medication     * Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label

     8)     PPS_7PRV_8NEW.DAT

The files must be installed in sequential order and take around
30 minutes each to install. Pharmacy will be down for that period
of time.  Do you want to install just the first one or all of them?

(F)irst file only or (A)ll files: F

Only the first entry will be installed.

# External Dependencies
This package relies on `XU*8.0*10002` released as part of the Kernel-GTM project
[here](https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM). 

On GT.M or Cache on Linux and Cygwin, these are the external dependencies:
`stat`, `wget`, `gzip`, `mv`, `grep`, `file`, `cut` and `dos2unix`.

On Cache/Windows, these are the external dependencies: `mkdir` and `wget`.

# Internal Depedencies
This package uses a lot of Kernel, Mailman, and Fileman APIs. A listing can
be obtained by running ^XINDEX against patch `PSN*4.0*10001`.

# Unit Testing
Tested manually. See usage instructions.
